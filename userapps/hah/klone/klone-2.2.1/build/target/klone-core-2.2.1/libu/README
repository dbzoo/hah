== LibU in a few words ==

LibU is a multiplatform (UNIXes, Mac, Windows) C library which comes under a
BSD-style license.  It includes many interdependent modules for doing different
things: memory allocation, networking and URI parsing (rfc2396), string
manipulation, debugging and logging in a very compact way, plus many other
miscellaneous tasks.  Its small footprint (about 70KB) and multiplatform
nature, makes it an ideal candidate for integration in bigger projects.  KLone
- http://www.koanlogic.com/products/klone - is an example of such a combination.


== Installation ==

LibU needs MaKL version 1.3.0 (or upper) to build.

You can download MaKL at http://www.koanlogic.com/makl: follow the steps
described in its README file to install it on your platform.  When 'makl' tool
is at your disposal, move to LibU directory (e.g.  /home/me/tgz/libu-0.5.0/)
and do the following:

    $ ./maklconf [--prefix=... --enable_shared ...] 
    $ makl
    # makl install

Shared libraries are not built by default, so you'll have to explicitly set
the '--enable_shared' flag in the configure step if you want/need them.

If you are installing LibU on a platform which is not yet supported by MaKL, 
you will have to create the following objects:

    * a toolchain file for MaKL (see tc/README file in MaKL package)
    * Makefile.conf and include/u/libu_conf.h for LibU

matching your platform settings and available tools.  

If you need support drop a line to one of {makl,libu}-users@koanlogic.com 
mailing lists and we'll be glad to help.


== Module Selection ==

The following modules can be left out through the given configure option:

    - hmap              (--no_hmap)
    - config            (--no_config)
    - net and uri       (--no_net)
    - env               (--no_env)
    - fs                (--no_fs)
    - pwd               (--no_pwd)
    - list              (--no_list)
    - array             (--no_array)

== Extra configuration flags

    - configure LibU for debugging      (--enable_debug)
    - compile LibU with pedantic CFLAGS (--enable_warns)
