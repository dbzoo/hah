# The may be configured in either [byte | pin] mode
#
# Byte mode will present a single XAP endpoint point that is
# controllable using BSC level=, Pin mode will create 8 XAP endpoints
# using state=on/off PPE devices are path to ground so when using
# LEVEL= a logical 0 will be ON.  For PIN mode the conversion is done
# internally so state=on will supply a 0 to the PPE and supply path to
# Ground.
#
# Note: Do not enable I2C control when you don't have I2C devices
#       attached at the specified address.
