This file describes how to use msmtp 1.4.0 or newer with Mutt.


1. Install msmtp:

     $ ./configure
     $ make
     $ make install


2. Configure msmtp:

   Create the file .msmtprc in your home directory, with no more permissions
   than user read/write (0600, -rw-------).
   Create a default SMTP account by putting the following commands in it:

     account default
     host smtp.yourprovider.example
     from you@yourprovider.example

   This is sufficient, but you may want to use SMTP authentication (instead of
   POP-before-SMTP for example). Simply add

     auth on
     user JoeExample
     password Secret

   to the same file.
   Using TLS encryption is always a good idea, so add the line

     tls on

   If you are not sure whether the SMTP server supports authentication and/or
   TLS encryption, find it out with

     msmtp --host=smtp.yourprovider.example --serverinfo


3. Tell Mutt to call msmtp instead of /usr/sbin/sendmail:

   Add the following lines to your Mutt configuration file:

     set sendmail="/usr/local/bin/msmtp"
     set from=you@example.com


4. If you want to know how to set up multiple accounts, advanced TLS options, 
   DSN, and other more or less useful stuff, read the msmtp manual. There's a 
   "Using msmtp with Mutt" paragraph in the Examples section.
