Things to do for ipkg, in a partial order:

0) Play with configure to check for strdup/strndup ( to works with replace/replace.h stuffs )

1) Fix incompatibilities between current C-based ipkg and original
sh-based ipkg.

1.a) Fix ipkg.conf options for http_proxy and friends. DONE:
     http_proxy tested, (ftp_proxy, no_proxy, proxy_user, and
     proxy_passwd have not been tested).

1.b) Fix export of PKG_ROOT during pkg_run_script. DONE: tested.

1.c) Fix so that a src with file:// is supported. DONE: tested.

1.d) Fix paths in list files. DONE: tested.

1.e) Fix offline_root mode. DONE: tested.

2) Release ipkg as ipkg, (no longer as ipkg-unstable). This depends on
   all of (1) being DONE. Although I might let this release proceed
   without offline_root --- only Jamey will complain. ;-)

3) Bug fixes

3.a) fix all code marked "XXX: BUG"

3.b) fix all outstanding ipkg bugzilla bugs

3.c) conffiles support seems broken again. It's prompting on just
     about every file. It might be because of file names beginning
     with "///".
	FIXED the "///" problem, (seemed harmless though), in 0.99.2
	FIXED a problem with conffiles with -force-reinstall in 0.99.2.
	This seems to be mostly working now, (I have seen strange
	prompting on one out of the three ssh conffiles, maybe the
	postinst script changed it? Hmmm... and something is going on
	with pcmcia-cs too. Mysterious.)

3.d) Test versioned Depends

3.e) Test Provides.  DONE.

3.f) Make sure Suggests, Recommends, (Enhances?), all work, (I know
     some of these are not yet implemented)

3.g) Audit all dpkg package fields for both parsing and printing support.

3.h) "ipkg status" and "ipkg info" need to complain about unknown
  packages. For that matter, these two commands should probably just
  become aliases to the same functionality.

  Jamey thinks ipkg status should be brief give one line per package, while
  ipkg info can continue to be verbose. 7/23/2002.

3.i) Currently "ipkg install foo" will upgrade foo if possible. The
  "Package foo is already installed" check needs to be moved up to
  avoid this.

  Jamey thinkgs that "ipkg install foo" should upgrade foo.  7/23/2002.

4) Implement new features

4.a) start with all "XXX: FEATURE" comments

4.b) implement all accepted ipkg bugzilla feature requests, (also
     check old post "Subject: Reinventing ipkg" to see if we forgot
     any of the good ideas we had once upon a time)

4.c) ipkg remove needs to (prompt first) then remove packages for
     which the dependencies will no longer be met. DONE. 7/19/2002.

4.d) Add support for:
	ipkg install foo from some-feed
	ipkg install foo-0.4.3
	ipkg install foo-latest # Only needed if we add a feed-order-priority option
     or something like that.

4.e) Orphaned dependency management (what is this -Jamey 7/23/2002)

4.f) Add code for HTTP GET to eliminate wget dependence, (see
     apps/urlget for code). We should probably still keep the wget
     call as a backup.  

     -- use busybox's internal wget -jamey 7/23/2002

4.g) Experiment with making a small statically linked binary. Can we
     eliminate some library calls, (glob, regcomp)? Can we get
     something like uclibc to work well?

4.h) Add support for a deb-src in /etc/ipkg.conf. (ARGH! Name clash
     alert! In apt-land, deb-src means something very different than
     what I would mean here. Hrm... Maybe src-deb would be cleaner? )

     (What is this?  Jamey 7/23/2002) 

4.i) Figure out a clever chroot mechanism for running maintainer scripts in
     offline_root mode.

4.j) Implement ipkg history mechanism, with undo and redo?  Keep track of
     packages removed/installed by each call to ipkg.

5) release ipkg-1.0.0

6) Cleanup the code

6.a) Start with all comments marked "XXX: CLEANUP"
