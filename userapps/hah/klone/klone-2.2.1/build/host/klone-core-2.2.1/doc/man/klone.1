.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP 6
\fBklone\fR [\fB\fIklone_opts\fR\fR] [\fB\-c\ \fR\fB\fIcmd\fR\fR] [\fB\fIcmd_opts\fR\fR] [\fB\fIcmd_args\fR\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBklone\fR
performs two different tasks depending on the argument supplied to the
\fB\-c\fR
switch: import a site directory tree into the KLone building environment (i.e. the embedded file system), or translate static and dynamic pages into C files.
.PP
The translation phase is rarely seen by the user since it is hidden in the Makefile of the site building directory, i.e.
\fI${KLONE_SRC_DIR}/site\fR. Generally, the developer gets an embedded version of his/her site by providing the following command sequence:
.sp
.nf
    $ cd ${KLONE_SRC_DIR}/site
    $ ../src/tools/klone/klone \-c import ${SITE_BASE_DIR}
    $ make
.fi
.sp
The latter
\fBmake\fR
invocation calls
\fB'klone \-c translate'\fR
over the imported files to perform the needed translation and registering (pre\-linking).
.PP
Note that whenever a source file is added, removed or renamed, or in case the embedded file system encrypting key changes, the import operation must be done again.
.PP
The subsequent phase, by which the embedded site is linked to the
\fBkloned\fR
server skeleton, does not involve
\fBklone\fR
anymore. Nevertheless, the steps are illustrated here for reference:
.sp
.nf
    $ cd ${KLONE_SRC_DIR}
    $ make
.fi
.sp
That's all.

\fBklone\fR \fB\-c\ translate\fR \fB\-i\ \fR\fB\fIinfile\fR\fR \fB\-o\ \fR\fB\fIoutfile\fR\fR \fB\-u\ \fR\fB\fIuri\fR\fR [\fB\-E\fR] [\fB\-k\ \fR\fB\fIkeyfile\fR\fR] [\fB\-z\fR]
.PP
Translate the active (i.e. a \fI.klone\fR file) or static page \fIinfile\fR
into C file \fIoutfile\fR. 

The \fB\-u\fR option specifies the \fIuri\fR associated with the translated file. 

The \fB\-E\fR option tells \fBklone\fR to encrypt the file content with the key
enclosed in the supplied \fIkeyfile\fR or in the environment variable
\fBKLONE_CIPHER_KEY\fR using AES\-256 CBC.

The contents of the translated files are compressed based on their MIME type if
the \fB\-z\fR flag is given.

.SS "Import:"
.HP 6

\fBklone\fR \fB\-c\ import\fR [\fB\-b\ \fR\fB\fIuri\fR\fR] [\fB\-e\ \fR\fB\fIpattern\fR\fR] [\fB\-x\ \fR\fB\fIpattern\fR\fR] [\fB\-k\ \fR\fB\fIkeyfile\fR\fR] [\fB\-Z\ \fR\fB\fIpattern\fR\fR] [\fB\-z\fR] \fB\fIdir\fR\fR
.PP
Import the site tree starting at
\fIdir\fR
into the KLone building environment. The command output comprises two makefiles (\fIautogen.mk\fR
and
\fIautogen.dps\fR) and the
\fIregister.c\fR
file which will gather the imported and translated site files. The latter file is the glue by which the embedded site can afterwards be linked to the HTTP/S server. 

When the \fB\-e\fR flag is given, the files matching the specified
\fIpattern\fR will be encrypted using the key enclosed in the supplied
\fIkeyfile\fR or in the environment variable
\fBKLONE_CIPHER_KEY\fR. 

The user can choose whether to compress all the imported files based on their MIME type, using the \fB\-z\fR flag, or to select a subset matching the supplied shell \fIpattern\fR.

If, while importing, you don't want to include a set of files you can use the 
\fB\-x\fR argument to provide the pattern of files you want to exclude.

Arguments \fB\-x\fR, \fB\-Z\fR and \fB\-e\fR may be used more then once.

.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.PP
The following environment variable affects the execution of
\fBklone\fR:
.TP
\fBKLONE_CIPHER_KEY\fR
If set,
\fBklone\fR
tries to read the embedded file system encryption key from it. It is be overridden by the
\fB\-k\fR
option.
.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
.PP
The
\fBklone\fR
utility exits with
\fBEXIT_SUCCESS\fR
on success, and with
\fBEXIT_FAILURE\fR
if an error occurs.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
