    <h1 ALIGN="CENTER">Memory Technology Device (MTD) Subsystem for Linux</h1>
    
    <H2>Design aims</H2>
    <P>We're working on a generic Linux subsystem for memory devices, 
      especially Flash devices.
    </P>
    <P>The aim of the system is to make it simple to provide a driver for new
      hardware, by providing a generic interface between the hardware drivers
      and the upper layers of the system.
    </P>
    <P>Hardware drivers need to know nothing about the storage formats used,
      such as FTL, FFS2, etc., but will only need to provide simple routines
      for <tt>read</tt>, <tt>write</tt> and <TT>erase</TT>.
      Presentation of the device's contents to the user in an appropriate form
      will be handled by the upper layers of the system.
    </P>

    <HR size=2>
    <H2>Mailing list</H2>
    <P>There is a majordomo-managed mailing list: 
      <B><I>lists-mtd@lists.infradead.org</i></B> - Full archives are available
      at <A HREF="http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-mtd/">
	http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/linux-mtd/</A>. Now that I've
      finally managed to get Mailman to display them properly, this includes
      all the previous messages from before the changeover to Mailman.

    <H2>Download and CVS</H2>

    <P>Very occasionally, I make snapshot releases. Now that the MTD code
      is in the 2.4 kernel, it's become even rarer. Your best option is to
      obtain the latest code from CVS, by following the instructions below.
      We do break the CVS build occasionally, but we're also fairly good
      at fixing it quickly when we do so. </P>

    <P>Anonymous CVS access is available, and full CVS access may also be
      granted to developers on request.

    <P>If you can't access anoncvs for some reason, daily snapshots 
      are also available at <A

    <H2>Documentation</H2>
    <P>There is now some <A HREF="tech/">MTD API documentation</A> available.
      It's a little out of date - the API has been evolving over the last
      few months as we encounter strange pieces of hardware that we hadn't
      anticipated, and occasionally when I'd just overlooked something
      blatantly obvious. Volunteers to update the docs are welcome.
      <br><br>13th Feb 2001: A <A HREF="ftp://ftp.uk.linux.org/pub/people/dwmw2/mtd/cvs/mtd/mtd-jffs-HOWTO.txt">mtd-jffs-HOWTO</A> is now also available under
    CVS. Not all topics are covered yet, but it's a start.
    </P>

    <HR size=2>
    <h2>Booting</H2>
    <P>You can now replace the firmware on the DiskOnChip 2000, and possibly 
    also the DiskOnChip Millennium, with a version of <A 
      HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/">GNU Grub</A> which runs directly
    from the flash.</P>

    <P>The patches to make Grub aware of the DiskOnChip and the NFTL format
      used on it, along with a first-stage loader to load Grub itself into
      memory from the DiskOnChip, are in the CVS repository.</P>

    <HR size=2>
    <H2>TODO</H2>
    <P>I'm impressed. The TODO list is getting much shorter.</P>

    <h2>MTD <I>User</I> modules</h2>
    <P>These are the modules which provide interfaces that can be used
      directly from userspace. The user modules currently planned include:</P>
    <UL>
      <LI><B>Raw character access:</B><BR>
	A character device which allows direct access to the underlying 
	memory. Useful for creating filesystems on the devices, before 
	using some of the translation drivers below, or for raw storage 
	on infrequently-changed flash, or RAM devices.
      </LI>
      <LI><B><A NAME="mtdblock">Raw block access</a></B><BR>
	A block device driver which allows you to pretend that the flash
	is a normal device with sensible sector size. It actually works
	by caching a whole flash erase block in RAM, modifying it as
	requested, then erasing the whole block and writing back the modified
	data.<BR>
	This allows you to use normal filesystems on flash parts. Obviously
	it's not particularly robust when you are writing to it - you lose
	a whole erase block's worth of data if your read/modify/erase/rewrite
	cycle actually goes read/modify/erase/poweroff. But for development,
	and for setting up filesystems which are actually going to be
	mounted read-only in production units, it should be fine.
	<BR>
	There is also a read-only version of this driver which doesn't have
	the capacity to do the caching and erase/writeback, mainly for use
	with uCLinux where the extra RAM requirement was considered too
	large.
      </LI>
      <LI><B>Flash Translation Layer (FTL)</B></LI>
      <LI><B>NFTL</B><BR>
	Block device drivers which implement an FTL/NFTL filesystem on the 
	underlying memory device. FTL is fully functional. NFTL is currently
	working for both reading and writing, but could probably do with 
	some more field testing before being used on production systems. 
      </LI>
      <LI><B>Microsoft Flash Filing System</B><BR>
	This provides a filesystem directly from the flash, rather than the 
	less efficient filesystem-on-FTL-on-flash setup. The current driver is
	in alpha-testing, but should allow read-only access to such 
	filesystems.
      </LI>
      <LI><B>Journalling Flash File System</B><BR>
	This was developed by <A HREF="http://www.axis.com/">Axis 
	  Communications</A>, and provides a filesystem directly on the 
	flash, rather than emulating a block device. For more information,
	see <A HREF="http://www.developer.axis.com/software/jffs/">Axis'
	  developer pages</A>.
      </LI>
    </UL>
    <HR SIZE=2>
    <h2>MTD hardware device drivers</h2>
    <P>These provide physical access to memory devices, and are not used 
      directly - they are accessed through the <I>user</I> modules above.</P>
    <UL>
      <LI><B>On-board memory</B><BR>
	Many PC chipsets are incapable of correctly caching system memory
	above 64M or 512M. A driver exists which allows you to use this
	memory with the linux-mtd system.
      </LI>
      <LI><B>PCMCIA devices</B><BR>
	There are already a number of PCMCIA memory devices supported by Linux.
	The MTD device subsystem is being designed with compatibility in mind,
	so that the <A 
	  HREF="http://hyper.stanford.edu/~dhinds/pcmcia/home.html">existing 
	  PCMCIA drivers</A> can cleanly interface to the new MTD
	subsystem. This work has not yet been undertaken, though.</LI>
      <LI><B>Common Flash Interface (<A 
	    HREF="http://www.pentium.com/design/flcomp/technote/cfi_1_1.htm">CFI</A>)
	  onboard memory</B><BR>
	This is one of the most interesting options for small embedded systems.
	With a filesystem directly on the flash, rather than through an extra
	layer like FTL, we can get execute-in-place (XIP) of programs and 
	libraries on the flash, without needing to use up valuable system 
	memory as a cache for the executable code.<BR>
	A patch to the Linux kernel which supports this is available, and it 
	should shortly be ported to the generic MTD system as a hardware
	driver.</LI>
      <LI><B>M-Systems' ISA Flash cards and DiskOnChip 1000</B><BR>
	These devices are very simple - they seem to consist of a large array
	of Intel flash memory, with a simple paging mechanism reminiscent of 
	EMS, which allows different pages of the flash to be mapped into the 
	device's 8K memory window. While working for Nortel a couple of years
	ago, I developed drivers for these devices.<BR>
	Unfortunately, I don't think the Disk-On-Chip 1000 is available any 
	more.</LI>
      <LI><B>M-Systems' DiskOnChip 2000 and Millennium</B><BR>
	M-Systems have now provided me with full documentation for the 
	DiskOnChip 2000 and Millennium. The current driver is capable of
	full operation on a DiskOnChip 2000, and I have received a
	sample DiskOnChip Millennium from M-Systems, so I should get round to
	adding Millennium support soon. The write support for NFTL appears
	to pass my simple tests for interoperability - after I mount it with
	my drivers, thrash it for a while, and unmount it, the NFTL is still
	recognised by M-Systems' own drivers. More testing of this would be
	very much appreciated.
	<BR>
	<I>The <A HREF="doc2000.html">Linux and Disk-On-Chip
	  2000 page</A> is available here. Please note that, now that 
	M-Systems have provided me with complete specifications with which to
	write a free driver for the device, there is no longer any reason 
	to avoid using it with Linux systems.</I>
	<HR>
	</LI>

      <LI><B>CompactFlash</B> - <A HREF="http://www.compactflash.org/">http://www.compactflash.org/</A><BR>
	CompactFlash emulates an IDE disk, either through the PCMCIA-ATA 
	standard, or by connecting directly to an IDE interface.
	<BR>As such, it has no business being on this page, as to the best of
	my knowledge it doesn't have any alternative method of accessing the 
	flash - you <I>have</I> to use the IDE emulation - I mention it here
	for completeness.
