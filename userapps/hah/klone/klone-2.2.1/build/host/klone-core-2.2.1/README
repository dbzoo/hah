QUICKSTART
----------

NOTE: KLone needs GNU make in order to be built, which is not the default 'make'
      on most *BSD systems (usually you will find it as 'gmake' or 'gnumake').

1) Configure and build KLone:

    $ ./configure && ${GNUMAKE}

2) Import the example web-application

    [ on Windows edit doc/example-site/etc/kloned.conf and remove syslog 
      logging paragraph ]

    $ ${GNUMAKE} depend
    $ cd site && ../src/tools/klone/klone -c import ../doc/example-site
    $ cd .. && ${GNUMAKE}
    $ su
    # ${GNUMAKE} install

3) Launch the KLone executable:

    [ on Windows register the service with "kloned -i" and start it using
      the Services console ]

    $ kloned

4) Start your web browser:

    [ start your web browser and go to http://localhost:8080/ ]
