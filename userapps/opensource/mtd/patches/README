This file is meant to give an overview of the files contained in this
directory as well as the proper way to patch your kernel to use the
latest MTD features.

FILE LIST
---------
* Configure.help - file containing documentation for all the options in
                   MTD and JFFS. The first option in the file shows where
                   to insert it into the main 'Configure.help' file in
                   your kernel

* byteorder-patch - patch to add byte order macros for some platforms

* grub-*.patch - patches for the GRUB bootloader to work with Disk On
                 chip devices

* lilo-mtd.tar.gz - patches for LILO to be able to access MTD devices
                    during boot

* mtd-2.2.*.infra.patch - partial patch file for patching the kernel build
                          system to bring in the MTD sub-system

* mtd-sparc64-2.4.x.patch - ioctl conversions for sparc64 32-bit userland.
                            This should be submitted to DaveM after MTD CVS
                            has been merged into the mainline.

* patchin.sh - handy shell script used to patch in the latest MTD file
               when the kernel build system has already been patched

* put_module_symbol-2.2.*.patch - patches to add in MTD module specific code

TRYING OUT MTD
--------------
There are two ways to use the latest MTD code. The first method is if your
are starting with a brand new kernel tree with not other patches applied.
The second method is if you have a kernel you are already making modifications
to and you simply want to get the latest MTD code.

METHOD #1
---------
  1) Grab the latest patch for your kernel revision with the 'mtd-patch-'
     prefix.

  2) Go to the top-level kernel directory and do 'patch -p1 < [patch-file]'.


METHOD #2
---------
  1) Edit the 'patchin.sh' script and change the LINUXDIR path if needed.

  2) Do 'source patchin.sh'.

  3) If you want the help text for all the MTD options, merge the
     'Configure.help' file found in the repository with the one in
     your kernel.

The patches used in Method #1 are update every Friday morning.
