Description: lightweight package management system
 ipkg is the Itsy Package Management System, for handling
 installation and removal of packages on a system. It can
 recursively follow dependencies and download all packages
 necessary to install a particular package.
 .
 ipkg knows how to install both .ipk and .deb packages.

 ipkg is intended to serve the same functions (and more) for
 Familiar that dpkg and apt serve for Debian, (while taking
 up much less space).
