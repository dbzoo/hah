msmtp is an SMTP client.

In the default mode, it transmits a mail to an SMTP server (for example at a 
free mail provider) which does the delivery. 
To use this program with your mail user agent (MUA), create a configuration 
file with your mail account(s) and tell your MUA to call msmtp instead of 
/usr/sbin/sendmail.

Features include:
- Sendmail compatible interface (command line options and exit codes)
- Many authentication methods
- TLS encrypted connections (including server certificate verification and the
  possibility to send a client certificate)
- Support for Internationalized Domain Names (IDN)
- DSN (Delivery Status Notification) support
- RMQS (Remote Message Queue Starting) support (ETRN keyword)
- PIPELINING support for increased transmission speed
- IPv6 support
- LMTP support
- support for multiple accounts

msmtp runs on UNIX-like systems, Windows, and DOS.
In particular, supported platforms include:
GNU/Linux (glibc, uclibc or dietlibc), FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, AIX,
HP-UX, MacOS X, OpenDarwin, Cygwin on Win32, Windows 9x/ME/NT/2000/XP/2003, 
MS-DOS/FreeDOS+DJGPP+Watt32.

Optional features, depending on external libraries (see the file INSTALL for
usage instructions):
- TLS/SSL support
  You need either GnuTLS >= 1.2.0 or OpenSSL >= 0.9.6 for TLS/SSL support.
  It is also possible to disable TLS/SSL support entirely.
- Additional authentication methods
  The built-in authentication code supports the PLAIN, LOGIN, CRAM-MD5, and
  EXTERNAL mechanisms. When GNU SASL support is enabled, some or all of the 
  mechanisms EXTERNAL, GSSAPI, DIGEST-MD5, CRAM-MD5, PLAIN, LOGIN, and NTLM
  are available, depending on the compile-time options used for libgsasl.
  GNU SASL >= 0.2.4 is required.
- Native language support (NLS)
  On systems other than GNU/Linux, you need GNU gettext if you want NLS.
